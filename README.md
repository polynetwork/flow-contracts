Poly Network CrossChain Contracts on flow.

## Contracts

### 1. ZeroCopySink && ZeroCopySource

ZeroCopySink/ZeroCopySource is used to serialize/deserialize data

### 2. CCUtils

CCUtils is used to verify signatures && deserialize crossChain message

### 3. CrossChainManager

CrossChainManager is used as a cross-chain gateway. It can receive messages from other contracts/resources and send these messages to other chains.

Interface: 
+ Resources which wanna send cross-chain message via CrossChainMessage must implement **@LicenseStore** && **@MessageReceiver**
+ **@LicenseStore**: Receive and store **@License** 
+ **@MessageReceiver**: Recevie and handle **CrossChainMessageData** and **@CrossChainMessage**

Resource & Struct:
+ **CrossChainMessageData**: The message from source chain
+ **@CrossChainMessage**: @CrossChainMessage is used to verify the identity of CrossChainManager. Only CrossChainManager contract is able to create @CrossChainMessage.
+ **@License**: Used to verify the identity of business resources(business resources mean those resources who use CrossChainManager to deliver cross-chain messages)
+ **@CertificationAuthority**: Used to issue lincense to business resource.
+ **@Admin**: Used to manage the CrossChainManager contract

Funtion:
+ crossChain(): business resources call this function to send cross-chain message.
+ verifySigAndExecuteTx(): Its called by relayer(realyer is a bot that relay transactions between different chains). Relayer relay data from relay chain to flow(or other chains). CrossChainManager will verify the data(In most case, it will verify both header, proof & signature, but flow do not support arbitrary signature verification & keccak256 now, so flow CrossChainManager only verify specially made signatures) and handle the data(call business resources based on data).

### 4. LockProxy

LockProxy is a business contract that implement FT cross-chain. It receives FT from user on source-chain, and release corresponding asset to user on target-chain.

Resource:
+ **@Locker**: Locker receives vaults from user and send cross-chain message via CrossChainManager to LockProxy on target-chain. LockProxy also receive cross-chain message from LockProxy on other chain via CrossChainManager, and release FT to user.

Function:
+ @Locker.lock(): Asset cross-chain entry.
+ @Locker.unlock(): Asset cross-chain export.
+ registerReceiverPath(): For now, cadence can not transform **bytes(e.g.[UInt8])** to **Path** , so we need to use a map to convert. It can be removed when [#1211](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1211) release.
